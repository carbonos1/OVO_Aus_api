## ⚡ Home Assistant Energy Dashboard

The integration ships three sensors purpose-built for HA's built-in **Energy Dashboard** (Settings → Energy). In each picker, choose the matching sensor from the **Energy Dashboard** device:

| Dashboard slot | Pick the sensor named |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Grid consumption** | *Grid Import (Energy Dashboard)* |
| **Return to grid** | *Grid Export (Energy Dashboard)* |
| **Solar production** | *Solar Production (Energy Dashboard)* |

These are cumulative month-to-date totals (`state_class: total` with a monthly `last_reset`), which is the form the Energy Dashboard expects — so daily and monthly bars populate correctly. Note OVO publishes usage with about a day's delay, so the dashboard fills in a day behind.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📊 90+ Sensors with Automatic Plan Detection

The integration connects to OVO's GraphQL API and automatically detects your plan, rates, and account details. No manual rate entry required.

| Category | What You Get |

| **Last 7 Days with Rate Breakdown** | Per-day split by rate type (EV_OFFPEAK, FREE_3, PEAK, SHOULDER, OFF_PEAK, OTHER) |
| **OVO Savings** | Daily, monthly, and yearly savings vs the One Plan (calculated by OVO) |
| **Hourly Data** | 7-day rolling window with per-hour granularity and heatmap sensor |
| **Week-over-Week Comparison** | This week vs last week with percentage changes for solar, grid, and cost |
| **Weekday vs Weekend Analysis** | Average daily consumption and cost by day type |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install via HACS (Recommended)

Click the button below to add the repository in one step:

[![Open HACS Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=HallyAus&repository=OVO_Aus_api&category=integration)

Or manually:

1. Open **HACS** > **Integrations** > three-dot menu > **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/HallyAus/OVO_Aus_api` as an **Integration**
3. Click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/HallyAus/OVO_Aus_api/releases)
2. Copy `custom_components/ovo_energy_au` into your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configure

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration**
2. Search for **OVO Energy Australia**
3. Enter your OVO email and password
4. Done -- your plan, rates, and 90+ sensors are created automatically

> ⚠️ **Don't pick the built-in "OVO Energy" integration!** Home Assistant ships a core integration called **OVO Energy** for OVO **UK** (domain `ovo_energy`). Searching "OVO" shows both — you must select **OVO Energy Australia** (domain `ovo_energy_au`), the one provided by this repository. If your error log mentions `homeassistant/components/ovo_energy` or `No customer id set`, you added the wrong (UK) integration: remove it and add **OVO Energy Australia** instead.

### Free 3 Plan: Peak/Off-Peak Split (Optional)

On the **Free 3** plan, OVO's API reports your non-free usage as a single `OTHER` bucket even though you're billed peak/off-peak rates. To split it, open the integration's **Configure** dialog and set the **Peak Window Start/End Hour** (e.g., 15 and 21 for a 3 pm - 9 pm peak). Usage inside the window is counted as peak, the rest as off-peak. Leave both at the same value to disable.

## 📡 Sensors

All sensors are grouped into logical device categories in Home Assistant for easy navigation.

### ⚡ Core Energy (Daily / Monthly / Yearly)

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Solar Consumption | kWh | Energy consumed from solar panels |
| Grid Consumption | kWh | Energy drawn from the grid |
| Return to Grid | kWh | Energy exported to the grid |
| Solar Feed-in Credit | AUD | Credit earned from solar export |
| Grid Charge | AUD | Cost of grid energy |
| Return to Grid Charge | AUD | Value of exported energy |

These six sensors are available for each period: **Yesterday**, **This Month**, **This Year**, **Last Week**, **Last Month**, and **Month to Date**.

### 💰 Rate Breakdown (Last 7 Days)

Seven per-day sensors showing consumption and cost split by rate type:

| Rate Type | Example Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `EV_OFFPEAK` | Overnight EV charging at discounted rate |
| `FREE_3` | Free electricity window (e.g., 11 am -- 2 pm) |
| `PEAK` | Highest-cost period |
| `SHOULDER` | Mid-cost period |
| `OFF_PEAK` | Standard off-peak |
| `OTHER` | Catch-all for remaining intervals |

Each day also includes counterfactual analysis showing what you would have paid on a different rate structure.

### 🏆 OVO Savings

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| OVO Savings (Yesterday) | Daily savings vs the One Plan |
| OVO Savings (This Month) | Month-to-date savings |
| OVO Savings (This Year) | Year-to-date savings |

These values are calculated by OVO's own comparison engine, not estimated locally.

### 🧠 Analytics & Insights

| Sensor Group | Sensors | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Week Comparison | 6 | This week vs last week (solar, grid, cost + % change) |
| Weekday vs Weekend | 4 | Average daily consumption and cost by day type |
| Peak Usage | 1 | Highest consumption 4-hour window |
| Self-Sufficiency | 1 | Percentage of energy from solar |
| High Usage Days | 1 | Top 5 consumption days (last 30 days) |
| Hourly Heatmap | 1 | Day-of-week / hour usage grid |
| Cost per kWh | 3 | Effective rates (overall, grid, solar) |
| Monthly Forecast | 3 | Projected total, remaining, and daily average |
| Solar Export | 4 | Export credit, rate, potential savings, opportunity cost |

### ⏰ Hourly Data

## 📊 Dashboard Examples

Ready-to-use YAML dashboard configurations are included in [`docs/dashboards/`](docs/dashboards/):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dashboard_simple.yaml` | Built-in cards only -- no custom components needed |
| `dashboard_example.yaml` | Comprehensive 4-view dashboard (mushroom + apexcharts) |
| `dashboard_hourly.yaml` | Dedicated hourly charts with solar/grid/export overlays |

Copy any of these into your Lovelace dashboard configuration to get started. They use standard Home Assistant cards and [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) for graphs.

### Quick Example

```yaml
type: entities
title: Yesterday's Energy
entities:
  - sensor.ovo_energy_au_yesterday_solar_consumption
  - sensor.ovo_energy_au_yesterday_grid_consumption
  - sensor.ovo_energy_au_yesterday_return_to_grid
  - sensor.ovo_energy_au_yesterday_grid_charge
  - sensor.ovo_energy_au_ovo_savings_ovo_savings_yesterday
```

### API

The integration communicates with OVO Energy Australia's GraphQL API:

- **Authentication:** OAuth2 PKCE flow via Auth0 (`auth.ovoenergy.com.au`)
- **Token refresh:** Automatic, with 401 retry and re-authentication fallback
- **Polling interval:** 5 minutes via Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator`
- **Data source:** Daily data is available after 6:00 AM for the previous day
- **Timezone:** `ZoneInfo("Australia/Sydney")` -- handles AEST/AEDT transitions correctly

### Null Safety

OVO's API can return `null` for charge fields when data is not yet available. All sensors handle this gracefully and show "Unknown" rather than crashing.

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| OAuth authentication fails | Verify credentials are for OVO Energy **Australia** (not UK). Check HA logs for details. |
| Sensors show "Unknown" | Wait until after 6:00 AM for yesterday's data. Check the Integration Health diagnostic sensor. |
| Sensors missing after install | Restart Home Assistant. Check Developer Tools > States for `ovo_energy_au` entities. |
| Token expires frequently | The integration handles this automatically. If persistent, remove and re-add the integration. |
