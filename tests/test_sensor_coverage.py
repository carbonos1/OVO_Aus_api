"""Namespace-coverage contract — the regression guard for the issue #74 bug class.

#74 was: analytics *computed* `hourly.time_of_use` every refresh but no sensor
ever read it, so the values never reached Home Assistant ("orphaned namespace").
A one-off test for the TOU sensors only covers that one instance. This test
covers the whole class:

Every analytics namespace the pipeline produces must be one of:
  1. consumed  — referenced somewhere in the sensor layer, or
  2. internal  — listed in INTERNAL_NAMESPACES (raw scratch / feeds / redundant), or
  3. known gap — listed in KNOWN_UNEXPOSED_GAPS (computed user-facing data not yet
                 surfaced; documented tech debt found by the orphan audit).

If a NEW computed namespace appears that is none of these, `test_no_orphaned_namespaces`
FAILS, forcing a deliberate choice: expose it, mark it internal, or record it as a
known gap. Conversely, once a known gap is exposed, `test_classified_namespaces_stay_unexposed`
fails until it is removed from the list — so the gap list cannot silently rot.

Granularity is top-level `coordinator.data` keys plus first-level `hourly.*` keys
(the level at which #74 occurred). Finer partial-exposure gaps inside `time_of_use`
(shoulder / ev_offpeak / free / other) and `peak_4hour_window` timing keys are
tracked in the orphan-audit report, not enforced here (their leaf tokens collide
with unrelated rate strings, making a source scan unreliable).
